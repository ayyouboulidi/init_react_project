- [Requirements](#Requirements)
- [React](#React)
- [Virtual DOM](#Virtual DOM)
- [Init a new project](#Init a new project)
- [Transpiler](#Transpiler)
- [Task runners](#Task runners)
- [First component](#First component)
- [Rooter](#Rooter)
- [What's next](#What's next)

# Requirements

-To start coding with react we need absolutly [node][5] and [npm][6] installed on our laptop.

-A minumum knowledge of ES6 (ECMAScript2015) (for more information on [ES6][1] )

-[JSX][7] is required.

# React
React is a great JS library to create UI. It is a library that you can add to an existing project or can create a new SPA from scratch.

**But what makes ReactJS a great library?**

React makes wrinting JavaScript easier with the **JSX**, helps you mix HTML and JS in one file with ease and clearly.
```
import React from 'react';

class Sum extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>2+3 = {2+3}</div>
    );
  }
}
```

# Virtual DOM

# Init a new project

# Transpiler

# Task runners

# First component

# Rooter

# What's next

The next step will be to learn how to handle **States** and learn **Observables**. [RxJS][4] / [Flux][3] / [Redux][2]
